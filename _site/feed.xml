        <description>&lt;p&gt;I remembered in 2002, when the first Uniqlo store opened in Shanghai, me and mom went to the store and even though there wasn’t a piece of clothes that was super well-designed, but I was thinking to myself “oh, you don’t have to buy really expensive well-designed clothes. if you put together in the right way, they can look really really nice.”&lt;/p&gt;
