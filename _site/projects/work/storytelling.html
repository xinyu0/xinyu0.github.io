    <h1 id="storytelling">Storytelling:</h1>

<p>A good story starts with a problem, goes through the painful process of solving the problem, and has a solution that is better than anything ever seen before.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-ideas-being-a-great-public-speaker">Sharing Ideas: Being a Great Public Speaker</h3>

<p>Watch Comedians</p>

<p>I watch great stand-up comedy before every talk. It puts me in a looser mood and makes me laugh, which relaxes me.</p>

<p>When possible, I will directly steal a joke from whatever comedian I’m watching. After all, they’ve tested out the joke, so it’s probably a good one that will work for me as well. I even practice imitating their timing: the way they pause, the way they change voices and move around the stage, everything.</p>

<p>Comedians are the best public speakers and are up against the most brutal audiences, so you must study them. Learn from them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do Not Use Powerpoint</p>

<p>I used to think I always needed a PowerPoint presentation. Because as useful as my words are, we’ve all heard that a “picture is worth a thousand words.” This is total BS. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then you are worth 100,000 pictures.</p>

<p>I compare comedian Daniel Tosh’s stand-up with his TV show Tosh.0. His stand-up just involves him, making jokes—no PowerPoint, no visuals, no pictures worth a thousand words. The Tosh.0 format involves him watching YouTube videos and making fun of them. His stand-up is better than the show. Even though the show is great, it isn’t as fun as just watching him do stand-up. In a similar fashion, PowerPoint will only distract from the main attraction: you.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wear Comfortable Clothes</p>

<p>I only dress in clothes I feel most comfortable in, even if everyone else is wearing tuxedos.</p>

<p>I wear a specific “uniform” when I speak: I wear a T-shirt I had custom made that has all 67,000 words of my book Choose Yourself! printed on it. And I wear a white shirt over it and black pants. Like a waiter. I’m at your service and I’ve chosen myself. BAM!</p>

<hr />

<p>Remember to Pause</p>

<p>I had this unnatural fear that if I paused too much during a talk people would get bored.</p>

<p>But inserting pauses allows people to think about what you are saying. It allows you to breathe, to be funnier, and diminishes the impression that you are rushing through the material. Take a drink of water. Walk from one side of the stage to the other. Do whatever you need to do.</p>

<hr />

<p>Have a Q&amp;A Portion</p>

<p>I enjoy Q&amp;A as much as the talk itself. So I arrange beforehand to do the maximum amount of Q&amp;A. Always good to have the audience as involved in your talk as you are.</p>

<p>ABS—Always Be Storytelling. Never give advice in a talk. Nobody, I don’t care who you are, is smart enough to just dole out advice. Just talk about your own experiences and what you did to help yourself. Mix in interesting facts. Straight out advice will never help anyone. Buddha himself realized this about public speaking. He said, “Don’t believe me on anything. Try this out for yourself.”</p>

<p>ABV—Always Be Vulnerable. Nobody wants to hear from Invulnerable Man or Ms. Perfect. They want to hear where you are scared and vulnerable and feeling insecure, because we all are.</p>

<p>Poor speakers create an artificial divide between themselves and the audience. They feel they need to do this in order to establish their own credibility. Let me tell you—there is no such thing as credibility. In one hundred years there will be no buildings named after any of us. Somebody has to be on stage and some people have to be in the audience. That’s the only difference.</p>

<p>Don’t put any thought as to why you are on the stage or how you need to be “better” than the people in the audience. You aren’t better. You’re simply the speaker. We all woke up lonely and confused this morning. What a miracle that we get to speak to one another.</p>

<p>And even better, we feed the soul by listening to one another. Ultimately, the best speakers are the ones who have put 10,000 hours into listening.</p>
