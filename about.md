Hi, my name is Xinyu.  
I am a Web & UI Designer currently living in Austin, TX. 
I like design and spend a lot of time on the internet reading about it and tinkering on codepen .
This site shows some samples of the projects that I have been worked on, mostly web sites and logos. You can read a little more about me on <a href="">here</a>, see what I'm working on at <a href="">Dribbble</a>, and read my <a href="">blog posts</a>. 

If you are interested in working with me or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to say hello.
