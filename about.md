Hi, my name is Xinyu.  
I am a Web & UI Designer living in Austin, TX. 
I like design and spend a lot of time on the Internet reading about it and tinkering on CodePen.
This site shows some samples of the projects that I have been worked on, mostly web sites and logos. <!-- You can read a little more about me on <a href="http://xinyudesign.com/2015/05/07/more_about_me.html">here</a>, see what I'm working on at <a href="https://dribbble.com/xinyu0">Dribbble</a>, and read my <a href="http://xinyudesign.com/blog/">blog posts</a>.  -->

If you are interested in working with me or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to say hello.
