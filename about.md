Hi, my name is xinyu. I grew up in Shanghai, China, and moved with my family to the U.S. in 2007. I'm currently studying web design @the iron yard in Austin.  

Before this, I was working in the hospitality field in Las Vegas after receiving my degree in finance in 2011. If you have heard about "quarter-life crisis," you kind of get the picture of my story. About 6 months into my first "real" job after college, I wasn't feeling good about the things I worked on at all. I know I wasn't doing anything valuable or meaningful, nor do I have any valuable skills to offer to other people. After reading millions of blog posts and going to a few networking events, I know I have to do something I care about, and that come down to 2 things -- design and tech. Luckily, I found this program in Austin and decided to go for it. And right now, I'm a designer in training and am happily surrounded by smart & like-minded people - students and teachers who are geeking out about fonts, colors, Html, Css everyday.  

When I'm not studying, I like to drink tea, listen to music, read mangas (Japanese comic books), and watch Asian TV dramas.
