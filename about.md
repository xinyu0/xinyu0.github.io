Hi, my name is xinyu. I grew up in Shanghai, China, and moved with my family to the U.S. in 2007. I'm currently studying web design @the iron yard in Austin. Before this, I was working in the hospitality field in Las Vegas after I received my degree in finance in 2011. When I'm not studying, I like to drink tea, listen to music, and read mangas (Japanese comic books).
