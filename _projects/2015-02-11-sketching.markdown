In today's class, Sam talked a lot about sketching, and why it's so important in the web design process. What I learned is "as a web designer, sketching is not about getting everything perfect. You don't have to draw the lines straight and have all of your boxes the same size. The point is to get your idea out of your head and down on paper. So don't worry about the details, you can work on them and clean things up later on." Also, there is an article from "A List Apart" that talks about this in more details [click](http://alistapart.com/article/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool). I found it very helpful.
