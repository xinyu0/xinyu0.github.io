Today we had a review on our first retrofitting homework.Here are the 6 things that I learned about working on a retrofitting project:

1. It's not supposed to be an easy thing to do. 
2. You may have to scrap a lot of the existing CSS. 
3. It's easier to first get everything in the right place. Then you can clean things up. 
4. It's okay to have whitespace on the global version. 
5. Don't worry about adding extra divs for the styling purpose only.
6. When you get stuck, try to talk about what you want to do or explain it someone else. You might end up figuring things out just by talking about it. (aka "Rubber duck debugging")
