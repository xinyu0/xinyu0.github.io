This week we started on our first major project on redesigning a website from one of the local restaurants. We picked a restaurant and will have 5 responsive web pages redesigned at the end. This series of blog posts will document my process from beginning to end. 

The first step in our project is creating a word list of everything we can think of about the restaurant. I picked Tarka. Here are a list words I came up with (I will add more later). 

1. India  [typecast](http://typecast.com/cq8YdKcjRz/share/c524b4a9ab71f5e538d64e1df3797c12ec4588fect3t7vR)  Because it's an Indian restaurant, India is the first thing comes to my mind. 
2. Spices  [typecast](http://typecast.com/cq8YdKcjRz/share/1737c665c8e5f914688361fb4ee0901b40e4cf12T2LMhC)  Indian food was known for using a lot of spices.
3. Spicy / hot  [typecast](http://typecast.com/cq8YdKcjRz/share/7fcec099a67679c867025d850c9ac6a8d96a99962t)  Indian food was known for being quite hot and spicy.
4. Quick & causal  [typecast](http://typecast.com/cq8YdKcjRz/share/000a359db85b91b5127c89a919a9e10a57fe64302Ng3wP)
