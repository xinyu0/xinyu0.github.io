Yes, everything around us was designed by someone: the desk, the chair, the lamp...
I always wonder how designers became that way; how do they see opportunities around them? how do they ask questions? and how do they create answers. 

Recently, more and more often I found myself asking questions like "do I like this design" and "why" and if i don't like it "why not?" Just when I was asking these questions, I realized I was able to exercise my brain much more often, and the more I do this, the stronger it gets. And doing this actually helps me make sense of the world around me. So never stop asking questions, and continuously explore possibilities.
