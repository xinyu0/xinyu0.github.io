After 2 weeks of dabbling with Html Css, playing with Codepen, ITerm, github, and doing all sorts of coding stuff, this week we kind of switched gear and started talking about grids, and how they were used on the web. Of course, before this week's lecture, even though I know that the layout of a website wasn't just a random choice, I wasn't very aware of grids, and didn't know how they were used. Learning that you can chop up a web page into 10 columns, 12 columns is very interesting, and now I know in the future I can have a system to apply when designing the layout rather than just lining things up based on my intuition. 

Grids are good. Learning it vs. actually putting it into use are 2 different things. Luckily, we don't have to design some layouts right away. Our homework assignments were to sketch on paper a few pre-exisitng websites. 

I am very much excited to work on this assignment. I like to draw since I was a kid, despite most of my sketches are ugly. Also, due to lacking of ideas, I haven't been doing it for many years. It feels good to sketch again. 

I spent an average of 40 to 60 minutes per sketch, and yes, it's not easy to draw a straight line.
