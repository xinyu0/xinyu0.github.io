I was really into Japanese comic books when I was a kid. I pretty much spent all my time and money on anime DVDs and mangas. I made drawings and paintings here and there but I did not think of this as anything more than a hobby until in my mid-to-late 20s, I found out that I really love design. In 2015, I dedicated myself into learning design, mostly websites and logos, etc. I went from someone with no design experience and skill set to someone who can design logos, icons and websites.
