Yes, everything around us was designed by someone. The desk, the chair, the lamp...
I always wonder how designers became that way. how they see opportunities around them? how do they ask questions? and how do they create answers. 

Recently, more and more often I found myself asking questions like "do I like this design" and "why" and if i don't like it "why not?" Just when I was asking these questions, I realized I was exercising my brain, and the more I do this, the stronger it gets. 

so what questions shall we ask everyday?
