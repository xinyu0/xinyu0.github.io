Today we had a joint lecture with FEE & ROR on git commands and designs. I've learned a lot more command lines and also realize that there is some common ground between developers & designers...both are trying to solve problems: FEE & ROR developers are making things to work and perform well. Designers are making things to look better and more appealing to their audience. So I might come back in a few months to take the FEE or ROR class. Who knows?
