Today we had a joint lecture with FEE & ROR on git commands and designs. I've learned a lot more command lines, and I am a little surprised that I kind of enjoy learning both - design and coding. This makes me realized that there is some common ground between developers & designers...  Both developers and designers are trying to solve problems: FEE & ROR developers are making things to work and perform well. Designers are making things to look better and more appealing to their audience. So, maybe after I finish the web design program, I will come back in a few months to take the FEE or ROR classes :)
