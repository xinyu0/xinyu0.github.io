We've been talking about the responsive web design in the last 2-3 lectures. It seems a lot people are embracing it because it's the new hot thing. I very much like rwd as one of many solutions in web design, and surprisingly the coding part is not as hard as I thought. But just as Sam talked a lot in class, rwd is not the solution for everything. 

We checked a few big websites today in class to see if they were responsible. The ratio is approximately 50/50. So to use or not use rwd (as a tool) ultimately has to do with the need of users. I also have been playing with a few sites in my free time, and came up with 3 conclusions that are highly subjective (and mostly likely wrong.) Feel free to correct me.

1. Yes, your site needs to be responsive. Sites like blogs, news sites, or any sites with long articles that I like to use my phone to read when my laptop or tablets are out of reach. 

2. No, when a mobile site/app is clearly a better solution. For example, sites like Gmail, I prefer using the mobile app when composing emails, and Twitter because you may want to take a picture on your phone. 

3. Maybe, when users may check your site on smaller screens but they don't want to use the mobile app. I would put McDonald's here. McDonald's do have a mobile site and an app, but their mobile site looks completely different. So a responsive site may be a better solution as it delivers a more consistent experience.
